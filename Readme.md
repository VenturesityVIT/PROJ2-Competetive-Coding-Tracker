A website to track competitive coding progress of club members.
Objectives :

1) This should include Codeforces,  Codechef, Hackerrank, Leetcode
2) Basically a clone of https://www.stopstalk.com/, but specifically for our club members only. This should also include ask a question and share your daily knowledge functionality.
3) Sharing daily knowledge can be implemented in form of daily emails to intrested members, or in form of daily cards

Build this keeping scalability in mind, We might scale it up in prod and publicise it.
